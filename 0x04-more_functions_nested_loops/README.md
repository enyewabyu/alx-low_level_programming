##More functions, more nested lops!
project done during **- full stack software enginnering studies**at**ALX School**
it aims to learn about nested loops in ** C ** language*
## techinologies
*c files are completing using gcc 4.8.4
*c files are written acording to the c90 standard
*tested on ubuntu 14.04.LTS
|filename   | description |
|-----------|-------------|
|0_isupper.c  |check for upper character|
|1. isdigit   |Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).|
|2. Collaboration is multiplication   | Write a function that multiplies two integers.
Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);                        |
|3. The numbers speak for themselves| Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_numbers(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code  |
|4. I believe in numbers and signs|                         |
|5. Numbers constitute the only universal language |                         |
|6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line             |                         |
|7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe|                         |
|8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch   |                         |
|9. Fizz-Buzz|                         |
|10. Triangles|                         |
|11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic             |                         |
|12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper
